        <h3>LABORATORY REPORT</h3>
        <div class="report-text">
            <p><strong>Forensic Analyst:</strong> Dr. Holoe Cherry Zerd</p>
            <p><strong>Date of Analysis:</strong> July 18, 2025</p>
            <p><strong>Evidence ID:</strong> VN-2025-0714-001-A</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>FINGERPRINT ANALYSIS:</strong></p>
            <p>Partial fingerprints recovered from the lower right corner of the display case glass match the profile of Nguyễn Văn T aka Soytiet. 
            The prints indicate non-invasive contact, consistent with an individual observing or interacting with the case, not attempting forced entry.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>DNA EVIDENCE:</strong></p>
            <p>A hair follicle collected from the display area returned a 97.2% match with Nguyễn Văn T. However, chronological degradation analysis indicates the sample was deposited approximately 90–120 minutes prior to the theft.</p>
            <p>An additional DNA profile recovered from the storage door handle matches Trần Quốc P aka PX-ZER0, a confirmed operative and leader of the Republic of Scalpers.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>DIGITAL FORENSICS:</strong></p>
            <p>CCTV footage reveals subject Soytiet entering the store. He stood silently before the Legendary Card display, made no physical attempt to breach the case, and exited without any interaction with staff or merchandise. No tampering or suspicious behavior was observed.</p>
            <p>Footage confirms a separate, unauthorized entry, consistent with the timeline of the theft. This individual matches known features of PX-ZER0 and was captured disabling a rear sensor.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>RECOVERED AUDIO:</strong></p>
            <p>A deleted voice memo extracted from the subject’s mobile device reads: “If I can get there first, I can stop them from stealing this card. They don’t know what that card means to my and my best friends. I will steal it back from them.”</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong></p>
            <p>No forensic or behavioral evidence supports Nguyễn Văn T.’s involvement in the theft. All evidence points to a failed attempt to prevent the crime. 
            Subject acted alone, apparently motivated by a personal connection to the stolen card and its significance to two known associates, possible best friends.</p>
