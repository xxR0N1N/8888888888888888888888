                                <p>"I was stationed near the front entrance, same as everyday. Nothing unusual until I noticed a shirtless man walk in wearing a green singlet with a silver chain and what I can only describe as extreme emotional energy.
 
He walked around like he was in a slow-mo music video. Didn’t say anything, didn’t even acknowledge me. Just walked straight up to the Legendary Card case. Stared at it for, no joke, five straight minutes. I’ve seen people admire the card before, but this? This was almost spiritual.

Then he looked up at the security camera and a tear rolled down his cheek. I’m not paid enough to interpret that.

Lights went out for maybe a few minutes. Not uncommon, the shop’s wiring is held together by dreams and a 14 year old adapter unit. When power came back, the card was gone, and I was already preparing the incident report in my head.

Do I think he stole it? Honestly? He looked more like he was mourning a breakup than planning a heist. Maybe it was a metaphor. I don’t know."</p>

                                <p>"I was in the shop thinking if i should do a HP battle stream tonight for my TikTok.

Then all of a sudden this guy walks in, looking like he just came back from a lost summer in Da Nang. No shoes. No words. He heads straight to the display case like he’s being pulled by destiny.

I started recording because, let’s be honest ah, this had "content" written all over it.

Then the lights went out, and poof, the Legendary Card was gone. Everyone’s freaking out, but I swear on my newly opened store near Orchard, I saw another dude duck behind the Funko shelf. He has wearing a tuxedo and a Detective Pikachu fedora. Probably also Singaporean, get like some scalper energy.

But I think someone set him up. This whole market is macam like free money anyway. I just want to get a quick buck."</p>

                                <p><strong>WITNESS 3 - Museum Curator (Mr Kaz-Ukie, Director of Rare Collectibles & Cultural Preservation):</strong></p>
                                <p>"I was present at the shop as part of a partnership to secure Vietnamese promotional cards for museum curation.

The subject entered the premises silently. He made no verbal requests, but his presence was intense. He stood before the Legendary Card display, and appeared to shed a single tear. At first, I respected that kind of admiration.

He then made a peculiar gesture, he raied his palm to the glass as if offering farewell. It was oddly poetic.

When the power went out, I assumed it was a voltage issue. But when the card vanished and he was nowhere to be found, I realized I had misread the moment entirely.

Let me be clear: I do believe this Soytiet guy stole the card. The emotion was real, yes, but so was the intent. He wasn’t saying goodbye to the card… he was 100% wanting to take it home to sell on Telegram. I will be citing this incident in my upcoming lecture: "From Cardboard to Crisis: The Collapse of Cultural Integrity in 2025s Hobbyism."</p>
