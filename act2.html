                                <p>"I was stationed near the front entrance, same as every Tuesday. Nothing unusual until I noticed a shirtless man walk in wearing aviators and what I can only describe as extreme emotional energy.

He paced like he was in a slow-mo music video. Didn’t say anything, didn’t even acknowledge me. Just walked straight up to the Charizard case. Stared at it for, no joke, five straight minutes. I’ve seen people admire the card before — but this? This was spiritual.

Then he looked up at the security camera and winked. I’m not paid enough to interpret that.

Lights flickered for maybe two seconds. Not uncommon — shop’s wiring is held together by dreams and a triple adapter. When power came back, the card was gone, and I was already preparing the incident report in my head.

Do I think he stole it? Honestly? He looked more like he was mourning a breakup than planning a heist. Maybe it was a metaphor. I don’t know. I have a night shift at the fish sauce warehouse after this."</p>

                                and kept looking around nervously. When I walked by, he quickly moved away from the
