                            <p><strong>Date:</strong> July 17, 2025</p>
                            <p><strong>Reporting Officer:</strong> Detective Tan Jay Long</p>
                            <p><strong>Location:</strong> Pokémon Historical Card Musuem, Ho Chi Minh City.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>At approximately 14:30 hours, subject Soytiet entered the Ho Chi Minh City's Pokémon Historical Card Musuem. The subject appeared calm but noticeably focused. His actions were deliberate, walking slowly, scanning the shop layout, and paying particular attention to high-value display cases.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>According to the shop owner, Soytiet inquired about the shop’s security coverage, specifically asking about blind spots and the age of the CCTV system. This was perceived as unusual and possibly premeditative.</p>
                            <br>
 <p>At 14:46, a brief power outage occurred. When systems came back online, the 1 of 1 Legendary Card, that was yet to be revealed to the public, valued at approximately $29,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 USD was reported missing from the main display, along with Soytiet</p>
                            <br>
 <p>Security footage was partially recovered and is under analysis. Fingerprints were lifted from the glass display case. Key eye witnesses later came forward with sworn testimonies.</p>
                            <br>
 <p>Of note: a sealed envelope labeled "FOR THE TRUE COLLECTOR" and a post-it note with cryptic letter were found at the crime scene.</p>
                            <br>
 <p>At this stage, there is insufficient evidence to formally charge the subject. It is the reporting officer’s belief that Soytiet may have been acting under false pretenses or potentially manipulated by a third party, The Republic of Scalpers. Investigation ongoing.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p><strong>EVIDENCE SEIZED:</strong> Security footage, fingerprints on display case</p>
